                question: "In a standard three-phase system, the three voltage waveforms are typically separated by 120 electrical degrees from each other.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "This 120-degree phase separation is fundamental to three-phase power, enabling smooth operation and efficient transmission."
            },
            {
                question: "A balanced three-phase system is characterized by equal magnitudes of phase voltages and currents, and a 90-degree phase displacement between them.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "A balanced three-phase system has equal magnitudes and a 120-degree phase displacement between voltage and current waveforms."
            },
            {
                question: "The instantaneous sum of the three phase currents in a balanced three-phase system is always zero.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "Due to the 120-degree phase shift, the sum of the instantaneous values of voltages or currents in a balanced system is always zero."
            },
            {
                question: "Three-phase power transmission generally requires more conductor material than single-phase transmission for the same amount of power delivered.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "Three-phase power is more efficient and requires less conductor material than single-phase for the same power delivery."
            },
            {
                question: "The instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase system pulsates at twice the supply frequency, similar to single-phase power.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "A key advantage of balanced three-phase systems is that the instantaneous power is constant and does not pulsate."
            },
            {
                question: "In a Wye-connected source, the line voltage is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the phase voltage.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "In a Wye configuration, the line voltage is the phasor sum of two phase voltages, resulting in a $\\sqrt{3}$ times magnitude difference."
            },
            {
                question: "For a Wye-connected load, the current flowing through a line is different from the current flowing through its corresponding phase.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "In a Wye connection, the line current is directly the same as the phase current because there is only one path for the current."
            },
            {
                question: "A four-wire Wye system's neutral conductor primarily carries current only when the connected load is unbalanced.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "In a perfectly balanced four-wire Wye system, the sum of phase currents at the neutral point is zero, so no current flows through the neutral wire."
            },
            {
                question: "If one phase of a three-phase Wye-connected motor develops an open circuit, the motor will generally continue to operate normally.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "An open circuit in one phase of a Wye-connected motor will cause it to single-phase, leading to reduced torque, overheating, and potential damage."
            },
            {
                question: "In a Delta-connected system, the line voltage is equal to the phase voltage.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "In a Delta configuration, the line terminals are directly connected across the phase windings, so their voltages are identical."
            },
            {
                question: "For a Delta-connected load, the line current is equal to the phase current.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "In a Delta connection, the line current is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the phase current because currents from two phases combine vectorially to form the line current."
            },
            {
                question: "A standard Delta-connected system inherently provides a neutral point for grounding purposes.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "A standard Delta system is a three-wire configuration and does not naturally provide a neutral point. Special connections are needed for a neutral."
            },
            {
                question: "An 'open Delta' (V-connection) occurs when one winding of a three-phase Delta source is removed, and it can still supply three-phase power.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "An open Delta can still deliver three-phase power, though its capacity is reduced to about 57.7% of a full Delta."
            },
            {
                question: "An unbalanced three-phase system implies that at least one of the phase voltage or current magnitudes is unequal, or their phase angles are not 120 degrees apart.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "Unbalance refers to deviations from ideal balanced conditions, whether in magnitude or phase angle of voltages or currents."
            },
            {
                question: "Symmetrical components is a technique used to simplify the analysis of balanced three-phase systems.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "Symmetrical components is specifically a powerful mathematical tool designed for the analysis of unbalanced three-phase systems."
            },
            {
                question: "In an unbalanced three-wire Wye-connected load, the sum of the three line currents will not necessarily be zero.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "According to Kirchhoff's Current Law, in a three-wire system without a neutral return, the sum of line currents flowing out of the source must still be zero, but the individual phase currents will be unbalanced."
            },
            {
                question: "In a four-wire Wye system with an unbalanced load, the neutral current will be non-zero.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "When a four-wire Wye system has an unbalanced load, the neutral conductor carries the imbalance current, resulting in a non-zero neutral current."
            },
            {
                question: "Unbalanced loads in a Delta system can lead to circulating currents within the Delta windings themselves.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "Unbalanced *source voltages* in a Delta can cause circulating currents. Unbalanced *loads* primarily affect line and phase currents but typically do not cause circulating currents within the Delta windings themselves unless there is an internal impedance imbalance."
            },
            {
                question: "Power factor correction is exclusively applied to balanced three-phase systems.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "Power factor correction is crucial for both balanced and unbalanced systems to improve efficiency, reduce losses, and avoid penalties from utilities."

                question: "Zero sequence components exist only when the sum of the three phase quantities (voltage or current) is non-zero.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "Zero sequence components appear when there is a common component in all three phases, causing their sum to be non-zero, often due to a ground path."

                question: "The total real power in a balanced three-phase system (Wye or Delta) is given by $P = \\sqrt{3} V_L I_L \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the phase angle between phase voltage and phase current.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "This formula is universally applicable for calculating total real power in a balanced three-phase system, using line quantities and the power factor angle."

                question: "If a three-phase motor is designed for a specific phase sequence, reversing any two of the three supply lines will reverse its direction of rotation.",
                answer: true,
                explanation: "Reversing any two phases changes the phase sequence, which in turn reverses the direction of the rotating magnetic field, thus reversing motor rotation."
            },
            {
                question: "Harmonics are not a concern in three-phase systems, as they are inherently balanced.",
                answer: false,
                explanation: "Non-linear loads in three-phase systems (e.g., rectifiers, VFDs) can generate significant harmonics, which can cause problems like overheating and waveform distortion."
